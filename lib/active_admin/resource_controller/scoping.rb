        #   ActiveAdmin.register Post do
        #     scope_to :current_user

        # method to call as the association. If its different, you can 
        # pass in the association_method as an option.
        #
        #   scope_to :current_user, :association_method => :blog_posts

        # will result in the following

        #   current_user.blog_posts.build
